## Requirements
* Install selenium: `pip install selenium`
* Download the chromedriver at [this url](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home). Make sure that you download the version corresponding to your chrome version (check your chrome version in Help->About Google Chrome). Then put the downloaded file in the top level directory of the repo and name it `chromedriver.exe` (for windows).
* Install beautiful soup: `pip install beautifulsoup4`


## Run it
To run it just execute `python main.py`. A browser window will appear,
and when the script is done a csv file will have been created in the `data` folder corresponding to the date scraped.
